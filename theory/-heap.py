"""
A common misconception is that a Heap is the same as a Priority Queue, which is not true.
A priority queue is an abstract data type, while a Heap is a data structure.
Therefore, a Heap is not a Priority Queue, but a way to implement a Priority Queue.

A Heap has the following properties:

Insertion of an element into the Heap has a time complexity of O(\log N)O(logN);
Deletion of an element from the Heap has a time complexity of O(\log N)O(logN);
The maximum/minimum value in the Heap can be obtained with O(1)O(1) time complexity.
